                            The first assignment that was assigned to us. The main task of this assignment was to replicate the very first website that Tim Berners-Lee 
                            published back in 1991.
                        </p>

                </td>

            <tr>
                <td><a class="links" href="Assignment 2 - Fashion Website/FashionClothesHomePage.html">Fashion Clothes</a></td>
                <td>
                    <div><h2 class="description-headers">Fashion Clothes Website</h2></div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The purpose of this assingment was for us to practise whatever we have learnt over the course. We would constantly go back to this assignment 
                            and edit it to make the code look cleaner, make the site look better, etc.  
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The main task of this assignment was to provide us an opportunity to practise using tables.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </td>

            <tr>
                <td><a class="links" href="Assignment 4 - Grid/Grid.html">Grid</a></td>
                <td>
                    <div><h2 class="description-headers">Grid Practice</h2></div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The main task of this assignment was to provide us the chance to practise how to incorporate grids in our websites and how to resize them 
                            and how to reize them according to what we need.
                        </p>
