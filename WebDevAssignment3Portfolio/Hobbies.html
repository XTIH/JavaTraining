            <p class="paragraph">Defense Of The Ancients 2, better known as DOTA 2, is Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and 
                published by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft 
                III: Reign of Chaos. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base 
                on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles 
                of play. During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player 
                versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.</p>

                or Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages that the Terrorists have captured. There are eight official game modes, all of which have distinct 
                characteristics specific to that mode.
