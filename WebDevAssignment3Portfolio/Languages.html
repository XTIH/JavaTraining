                English is the largest language by number of speakers, and the third most-spoken native language in the world, after Standard Chinese and Spanish. 
                It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states. There 
                are more people who have learned it as a second language than there are native speakers. As of 2005, it was estimated that there were over 2 billion 
                speakers of English. English is the majority native language in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, an 
                official and the main language of Singapore, and it is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania.
                It is a co-official language of the United Nations, the European Union and many other world and regional international organisations. It is the most
                widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch. English speakers are called "Anglophones". 
                There is much variability among the many accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions—in terms of phonetics and phonology, 
                and sometimes also vocabulary, idioms, grammar, and spelling— but it does not typically prevent understanding by speakers of other dialects and 
                accents, although mutual unintelligibility can occur at extreme ends of the dialect continuum.

                Standard Chinese (Standard Mandarin), based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin, was adopted in the 1930s and is now an official language of both the 
                People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan), one of the four official languages of Singapore, and one of the six official languages of
                he United Nations. The written form, using the logograms known as Chinese characters, is shared by literate speakers of mutually unintelligible dialects. 
                Since the 1950s, simplified Chinese characters have been promoted for use by the government of the People's Republic of China, while Singapore officially
                 adopted simplified characters in 1976. Traditional characters remain in use in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and other countries with significant overseas
                  Chinese speaking communities such as Malaysia (which although adopted simplified characters as the de facto standard in the 1980s, traditional 
                  characters still remain in widespread use).

                Japanese (日本語, Nihongo [ɲihoŋɡo]) is an East Asian language spoken by about 128 million people, primarily in Japan, where it is the national language. 
                It is a member of the Japonic (or Japanese-Ryukyuan) language family, and its ultimate derivation and relation to other languages is unclear. Japonic languages 
                have been grouped with other language families such as Ainu, Austroasiatic, Korean, and the now-discredited Altaic, but none of these proposals has gained 
                widespread acceptance.

                Korean (South Korean: 한국어/韓國語, hangugeo; North Korean: 조선말/朝鮮말, chosŏnmal) is an East Asian language spoken by about 77 million people, mainly 
                Korean, as of 2010. It is the official and national language of both North Korea and South Korea (originally Korea), with different standardized official 
                forms used in each country. It is a recognised minority language in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County of Jilin 
                Province, China. It is also spoken in parts of Sakhalin, Russia and Central Asia.
